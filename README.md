# Derivative-Free-Learning
Exploration of Derivative Free Learning Methods in Machine Learning

I have done this project at ISAE-SUPAERO in Toulouse, France during my second year as an Engineering student,
under the supervision of Youssef Diouane, Professor in Mathematics there.
It is meant to explore the possibilities of a learning without any derivatives for neural networks.<br/>
<b>The final paper summarizing this research can be found as "paper.pdf" in this repository.</b>
